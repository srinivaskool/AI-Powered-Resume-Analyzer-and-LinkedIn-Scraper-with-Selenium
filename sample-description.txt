Description:-
You’ll be working with a team of computer vision and deep learning researchers and engineers to implement world-class algorithms and experiences that work without constraints of what’s possible. As a Machine Learning Research Engineer on this team, you will work rapidly and multi-functionally to understand and implement state of the art techniques, explore capabilities of future hardware and sensors, translate ideas into interactive experience prototypes to guide decision-making, and drive the incubation of those technologies towards product.

Key Qualifications:-
Strong Python/C++ skills with ability to rapidly prototype ideas, and refine towards production.
Background in computer vision and machine learning.
Be able to adapt existing innovative ML models and train/fine-tune them in novel settings, i.e. with new data domain, or implement on-device.
Familiarity with 3D graphics, geometry and classical CV concepts a plus.
Comfort with data manipulation and data pipelining.
Experience with Swift/Metal/Shaders/CoreML is a plus.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills in a multi-functional setting.
